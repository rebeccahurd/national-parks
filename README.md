# "National Park Geek" - Project 

I completed this project as a part of the Tech Elevator coding bootcamp. The requirements were as follows: 

1. The site will need to have a consistent styling look and feel, using CSS.
2. Create a homepage to display a list of national parks, containing a summary of each park.
3. Each national park should have its own details page, which will be read from a Park Data Source.
4. Each details page should include a weather overview, with a link to detailed 5-day weather forecasts, which will be read
from a Weather Forecast Data Source File.
5. The weather details page should also display tips to a visitor for preparing for the weather.
6. Users should be able to specify whether they want temperatures displayed in C or F. 
7. Include a survey that visitors can take to vote on a favorite national park.

This was a "capstone" project, synthesizing many concepts we studied, including File I/O, the Spring MVC framework, Servlets,
dependency injection, and class modeling (with an emphasis on inheritance in the Data Access Object classes).
